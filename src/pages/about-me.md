I’m **Ram**, and this is my journey from **a curious beginner to a developer building AI-powered applications**.
The story doesn’t end here—it’s just the beginning.

### My Tech Journey 💻🚀

I started developing my first commercial projects as a **web developer in 2017**, but my passion for technology began long before that. Growing up, I was always fascinated by how things worked on a computer—curious about the software behind the screen and eager to build something of my own.

When I first got hands-on access to a computer, I experimented with creating basic **static websites using HTML and CSS**. They weren’t responsive, and the design was simple, but seeing my work come alive online made me realize—I wanted to keep going deeper.

## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

By 2017, I had started taking on **commercial projects**, and step by step, I moved from static sites into more advanced stacks. I began learning **JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and frameworks** that allowed me to build interactive, real-world applications.

Over time, I expanded my skills into **Python, Flutter (Dart), Vue.js, Flask, and Django**, building projects that went beyond the basics and tapped into **AI, data science, and app development**.

## Projects That Shaped My Journey 📂

My GitHub ([Ram-Devopss](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss)) is my workshop—a space where I build, experiment, and share projects across web, mobile, and AI domains. A few highlights:

* 🔮 **[Python-Bitcoin-Prediction-Model](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/Python-Bitcoin-Prediction-Model)** → Machine learning model predicting Bitcoin trends with visualized plots.
* 🏨 **[HTML-MYSQL-Resort-Booking-Web](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/HTML-MYSQL-Resort-Booking-Web)** → A resort booking platform with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap frontend + MySQL database.
* 📱 **[Flutter-Daily-Day-Attendance](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/Flutter-Daily-Day-Attendance)** → Mobile app for tracking attendance.
* 🥛 **[Flutter-Agaram-Milk-Dairy](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/Flutter-Agaram-Milk-Dairy)** → A dairy management application.
* 💬 **[CHATTER-BOT-ChatGpt-Django](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/CHATTER-BOT-ChatGpt-Django)** → Chat app powered by **ChatGPT API**.
* 🤖 **[English-to-Hindi-Translate-Bot](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/English-to-Hindi-Translate-Bot)** → NLP bot enabling language translation.
* 📚 **[VUE.js-FLASK-library-management](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/VUE.js-FLASK-library-management)** → Library system with Vue.js frontend and Flask backend APIs.
* 🛒 E-commerce projects like **[Gadgets-Web](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/Gadgets-Web)**, **[Furniture-Products-Web](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/Furniture-Products-Web)**, **[DairyProducts-Web](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/DairyProducts-Web)**—hands-on practice with PHP, SCSS, and responsive design.
* 📊 **[Customer-Time-Estimation-on-E-Commerce](https://github.com/Ram-Devopss/Customer-Time-Estimation-on-E-Commerce-Website-Jupiter-Notebook-)** → Data science project estimating user behavior on e-commerce sites.

Each of these represents a step forward: from building websites to experimenting with **AI, machine learning, and real-world applications**.

## Expanding Into AI & Deep Learning 🧠

My curiosity led me to **Artificial Intelligence and NLP**, where I deepened my expertise through advanced learning and hands-on projects.

I earned certifications from LinkedIn Learning in:

* 🎓 **Advanced NLP with Python for Machine Learning**
* 🎓 **Advanced Python Projects: Build AI Applications**
* 🎓 **Full-Stack Deep Learning with Python**

Through these, I strengthened my skills in:

* **LLMs, spaCy, Keras, CNNs, AI Chatbots, Flask APIs, MLOps**
* Building **end-to-end AI applications** integrating frontend, backend, and machine learning pipelines.

## Sharing Knowledge & Growth 🌱

Alongside building, I enjoy **sharing knowledge**—helping peers understand programming concepts, mentoring beginners, and contributing code openly.

I believe that explaining something to others is the best way to master it yourself.

---

## Today & Beyond (2025) 🚀

Today, I continue to work on **Flutter apps, AI-powered bots, web applications, and machine learning experiments**. My focus is not only on building projects but also on **creating solutions that have impact**—from prediction models to real-world management apps.

What keeps me going is **curiosity, problem-solving, and the drive to learn**. Every project is a chance to push boundaries, whether in AI, mobile apps, or full-stack web development.

And when I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me sipping ☕ and thinking about my next project idea.
